# Archipel UI

Archipel UI connects to Archipel Chain and shows it's state.

## Installation

The code can be installed using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/luguslabs/archipel.git
cd ./ui
```

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

You can start the template in development mode to connect to a locally running node

```bash
yarn start
```

You can also build the app in production mode,

```bash
yarn build
```
and open `build/index.html` in your favorite browser.

## Configuration

The template's configuration is stored in the `src/config` directory, with
`common.json` being loaded first, then the environment-specific json file,
and finally environment variables, with precedence.

* `development.json` affects the development environment
* `test.json` affects the test environment, triggered in `yarn test` command.
* `production.json` affects the production environment, triggered in
`yarn build` command.

Some environment variables are read and integrated in the template `config` object,
including:

* `REACT_APP_PROVIDER_SOCKET` overriding `config[PROVIDER_SOCKET]`
* `REACT_APP_DEVELOPMENT_KEYRING` overriding `config[DEVELOPMENT_KEYRING]`
